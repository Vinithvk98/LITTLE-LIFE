# LITTLE-LIFE

In the context of antenatal care, this project explores the application of machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis of fetal health. It involves training and evaluating predictive models using an extensive dataset encompassing baseline values, accelerations, fetal movement, uterine contractions, decelerations, and various physiological characteristics. Additionally, features extracted from fetal heart rate histograms are incorporated into the dataset. The objective is to develop accurate models capable of successfully predicting fetal health outcomes, enabling timely interventions by medical practitioners through the utilization of machine learning algorithms. Feature selection techniques are employed to identify the most informative variables, and strategies are implemented to address class imbalance issues.
